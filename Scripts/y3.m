% This function returns the output value of system 3.
 
function [yOut]  = y3(x,~,~)  % function handle

% Input to this function is x array.
% Output of this function is y matrix with values w and w'

yOut = x;  % Output value of the equation stored in yOut variable.
           % Y matrix for this system will be of N x 2 because of two outputs.
