% This function returns the output value of system 2

function [yOut]  = y2(x,~,~)   % function handle
% Input to this function is x array.
% Output of this function is y matrix with values w and w'

yOut = x; % Output value of the equation stored in yOut variable.
% Y matrix for this system will be of N x 2 because of two outputs.
