# Simulation-of-dynamic-systems-using-Euler-AB-2-RK-4-Integration-methods
- This project aims at creating a set of MatLab functions that can be utilized to simulate any dynamic system by either Euler, AB-2 or RK-4 integration method. There are three different dynamic systems considered in this project and all are evaluated with all three different integration methods mentioned above. The simulation results are also verified with the Simulink solver and those are also discussed in this project.
- All three integration equations are successfully coded in MatLab script. The simulation graphs are plotted for all three dynamic systems described above. The verification of these simulation results is also accomplished which will be found in project report.

Technologies Used:
  -
  - Language: MATLAB
  - Simulation Platform: SIMULINK
